## FAQs

**Q1: What is the difference between a Deployment and a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?**

**A:** A **Deployment** manages the desired state of your application, including updates and scaling, by controlling ReplicaSets. A **ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. While ReplicaSets are a lower-level concept, Deployments provide higher-level management features such as declarative updates and rollbacks.

---

**Q2: How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) determine when to scale?**

**A:** HPA monitors specified metrics (default is CPU utilization) and adjusts the number of Pod replicas to maintain the target metric value. For example, if the average CPU usage exceeds the target threshold, HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load.

---

**Q3: Can I use custom metrics for HPA instead of CPU/memory?**

**A:** Yes, Kubernetes HPA supports custom metrics. You can configure HPA to scale based on application-specific metrics by integrating with monitoring tools like Prometheus and using the Kubernetes Metrics API.

---

**Q4: What happens during a rolling update in Kubernetes?**

**A:** During a rolling update, Kubernetes gradually replaces old Pods with new ones based on the updated Deployment configuration. It ensures that a minimum number of Pods are available at all times, minimizing downtime and maintaining application availability.

---

**Q5: How do I rollback a Deployment to a previous version?**

**A:** To rollback a Deployment, use the `kubectl rollout undo` command:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/flask-deployment
```
This command reverts the Deployment to the previous Revision, restoring the previous application version.
